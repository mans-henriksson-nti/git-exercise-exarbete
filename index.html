            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>What is RTS?</h3>
            <p>Rail Traffic Simulator (RTS) is a game where you simulate a rail system (surprised?).</p>
            <p>The idea is to give the player options to create stations with platforms and switches, and lines between the stations controlled by automatic block signalling. The player would then choose rolling stock for the line and create a timetable.</p>
            <h3>How was RTS made?</h3>
            <p>RTS was made in [language] and [framework] with [technology].</p>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>Download the installation file and install.</p>
            <h2>User Instructions</h2>
            <p>When you open the game, start the tutorial.</p>

            <h3>The point</h3>
            <p>The point of this website is to help with worldbuilding. The tool keeps track of trade routes and these variables therein:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resources that traverse the road</li>
                <li>How long it takes for a shipment to traverse the road</li>
                <li>Dangers along the road</li>
                <li>Average losses of resources</li>
            </ul> 
            
            <p>The trade routes are algorithmically generated and account for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty in terrain, trade routes prefer to traverse flat dry land or oceans instead of rocky mountains</li>
                <li>Species prefrences to terrain, if a species are very quick to traverse a specific type of terrain they will prefer to use it as a trade route.</li>
            </ul> 
            
            <p>Cities and other tradehubs have export and import needs, farmers wonuldn't be buying grain or selling bricks.</p>
            
            <h3>The how</h3>
            <p>Pathfinding, hexagonal terrain generation, Dijkstra's algroithm</p>
